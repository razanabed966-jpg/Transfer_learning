ðŸ§  Transfer Learning Projects

ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains a collection of practical projects in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning, with a strong focus on Transfer Learning techniques.
The projects demonstrate how to reuse pre-trained models to achieve high accuracy and efficient training across different tasks, spanning both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.

ðŸš€ Projects

1. Transfer Learning Mechanism

A conceptual and practical explanation of how transfer learning works, showing how pre-trained models can be reused and fine-tuned for new tasks.


---

2. Binary Image Classification

A project for classifying images into two categories (e.g., cat/dog, healthy/sick) using transfer learning with models like VGG16 or ResNet, and improving performance through fine-tuning.


---

3. Multi-Class Image Classification

Using MobileNetV2, this project classifies images into multiple categories. The final layers are retrained to adapt to the dataset, and performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.


---

4. Facial Emotion Recognition

An application of Transfer Learning to detect human emotions from facial expressions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.) using pre-trained deep learning models on facial datasets.


---

5. Text Representation

An exploration of several text representation techniques such as Tokenization, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, FastText, and BERT, preparing text data for machine learning and NLP tasks.


---

6. Word Embedding Training

Training Word2Vec and FastText models to generate numerical vector representations (embeddings) for words â€” useful for improving NLP model performance in classification and sentiment analysis.


---

7. Spam Message Classification

An NLP-based application using Transfer Learning to classify messages as spam or not spam (ham). The model leverages pre-trained embeddings and deep learning classifiers.


---

8. Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

A deep learning model for classifying text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral using advanced word embeddings like BERT.


---

9. Multi-Topic News Classification

A project that classifies news articles into multiple topics â€” such as politics, sports, economics, and entertainment â€” using Transfer Learning and NLP techniques.
It includes dataset preparation, model construction, and performance evaluation.
